(* Invariant proofs *)

(* A simple auxiliary lemma: appending [U] does not change the I-count *)
Lemma i_count_app_U: forall l, i_count (l ++ [U]) = i_count l.
Proof.
  induction l.
  - simpl.
    reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    rewrite IHl.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(* Rule R1 simply adds a U at the end when the last symbol is I, so it preserves i_count. *)
Theorem rule_1_preserves_i_count : forall (l : list MIU), i_count (apply R1 l) = i_count l.
Proof.
  intros l.
  destruct l as [|a l'].
  - simpl.
    reflexivity.
  - unfold apply.
    unfold rule_1.
    destruct (last (a :: l') U) eqn:Hl.

      rewrite i_count_app_U.
      reflexivity.
    + (* last symbol is U *)
      reflexivity.
Qed.

(* The standard MIU invariant is that in any derivable string the number of I's is not divisible by 3.
   In symbols, starting from [M; I] we always have ~(3 %| i_count s).
   For rule R2, one shows that if l = prefix ++ suffix with prefix ending in M,
   then i_count l = i_count suffix (since i_count prefix = 0) and rule R2 yields
   prefix ++ suffix ++ suffix, i.e. 2*(i_count suffix). Since 2 is invertible mod 3,
   3 ∤ i_count l  implies 3 ∤ (2 * i_count l).
   
   Rule R3 subtracts 3 I's (if it replaces III with U), and rule R4 does not affect I's.
   We state these facts as lemmas (proof details omitted and left as admit). *)

Lemma rule_2_preserves_invariant: forall l,
  (3 %| i_count l) = false ->
  (3 %| i_count (apply R2 l)) = false.
Proof.
  intros l H.
  (* Proof: Write l as prefix ++ suffix via split_at_M, observe that i_count prefix = 0,
     so i_count l = i_count suffix and i_count (apply R2 l) = 2 * i_count suffix.
     Since multiplication by 2 is an automorphism modulo 3, the property is preserved. *)

Admitted.

Lemma rule_3_preserves_invariant: forall l,
  (3 %| i_count l) = false ->
  (3 %| i_count (apply R3 l)) = false.
Proof.

  (* Proof: Replacing III by U subtracts 3 from the I‑count.
     Since subtracting a multiple of 3 does not affect divisibility by 3, the invariant holds. *)

Lemma rule_4_preserves_invariant: forall l,
  (3 %| i_count l) = false ->
  (3 %| i_count (apply R4 l)) = false.
Proof.

  (* Proof: Rule R4 removes UU, which does not affect the I‑count. *)

Admitted.

(* We then conclude that every move preserves the invariant: *)
Lemma move_preserves_invariant: forall m l,
  (3 %| i_count l) = false ->
  (3 %| i_count (apply m l)) = false.
Proof.
  intros m l H.

Proof.

(* By induction on a sequence of moves, the invariant is maintained. *)
